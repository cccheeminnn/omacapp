    <h1>Welcome to the Help! page.</h1>
    The app works pretty straightforward, user should upload a .csv file with populated with street names like the following files. 
    <a th:href="@{https://bigcontainer.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/OMAC/Sample/Sample/SG%20Streets%20Name%20-%2050.csv}">50</a>,
    <a th:href="@{https://bigcontainer.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/OMAC/Sample/Sample/SG%20Streets%20Name%20-%20250.csv}">250</a>, or
    <a th:href="@{https://bigcontainer.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/OMAC/Sample/Sample/SG%20Streets%20Name%20-%20500.csv}">500</a> Singapore street names
    <br>
    <br>
    The two things to look out for are the column header should be "address" and the column fields should ONLY consist of the street name. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Depending on how many streets are uploaded the query would take longer/shorter. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After the query is complete, a file is created on DO spaces and a direct download link to the file is given to the user,
    <br>
    the user can then either choose to download to the file or have it sent to their email instead!
